1..Mention the difference between interpreter and compiler. 

Ans----
        Interpreter translates just one statement of the program at a time into machine code.

    Compiler scans the entire program and translates the whole of it into machine code at once.

An interpreter takes very less time to analyze the source code. However, the overall time to execute the process is much slower.    

A compiler takes a lot of time to analyze the source code. However, the overall time taken to execute the process is much faster.
